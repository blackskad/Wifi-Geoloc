Wifi-Geoloc is an open source tool to create a database with locations of wifi accesspoints.

# Android
It currently contains a basic android app to find networks and link them to locations. The networks are currently not stored at all, just displayed in a simple list in the android application.

# Next steps

 * Create a server app to store the measurements and combine them to get an better guess at the actual location. Also add a map to display the known AP's. Also add an option to delete AP's from the system, to prevent critics from sceptical people.
 * iOS/win7/blackberry clients?
